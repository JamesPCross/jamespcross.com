I am committed to innovative teaching that integrates computational methods with political science. I received the UCD Teaching Excellence Award (2024) and the PSAI Teaching Award (2019). In 2019, I founded the [MSc in Politics and Data Science](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/study/mscpoliticsdatascience/) at UCD, which is now the 3rd largest programme cohort in the school.
