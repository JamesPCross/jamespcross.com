I am an Associate Professor of Political Science at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/) (UCD) and Director of the [Connected_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/). My research focuses on EU politics, computational political science, and text-as-data methods. I am particularly interested in how natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) can be applied to political science research.

My current projects include [ParliView](https://parliview.org), an AI-driven parliamentary transparency tool funded by a Google.org grant (EUR 1.5m), and a Research Ireland funded COALESCE project looking at the UN's sustainability goals in the European Union. I co-founded the [COMPTEXT Association](https://www.comptextconference.org/) and serve as its Secretary. I also founded and direct the [MSc in Politics and Data Science](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/study/mscpoliticsdatascience/) at UCD.

I received my PhD from [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/) in 2011, and held postdoctoral positions at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/) and the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/) before joining UCD in 2014. My work has been published in journals including the *Journal of European Public Policy*, *European Union Politics*, *Political Analysis*, the *European Journal of Political Research*, and the *Journal of Common Market Studies*.
