The [MSc in Politics and Data Science](https://www.ucd.ie/spire/study/mscpoliticsdatascience/) was founded in 2019 and is now the 3rd largest programme cohort in the School of Politics and International Relations at UCD (out of 27 programmes). The programme trains students in computational methods -- including text analysis, machine learning, and data visualisation -- and their application to political science research questions.

Students develop skills in programming (Python and R), statistical analysis, and natural language processing while applying these methods to substantive questions in political science. The programme was developed with support from the European Commission's Jean Monnet Programme and reflects a commitment to preparing the next generation of political scientists for a data-rich research environment.
