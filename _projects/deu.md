The [Decision-Making in the European Union (DEU)](https://www.robertthomson.info/research/resolving-controversy-in-the-eu) dataset is a large-scale data collection project that tracks legislative decision-making in the EU. The dataset covers controversial legislative proposals and records the positions of member states, the European Commission, and the European Parliament, as well as the final decision outcomes.

The DEUII dataset, published in the *Journal of European Public Policy* (Thomson et al. 2012), extended the original DEU dataset to cover the period after the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, providing researchers with a valuable resource for studying how EU decision-making has evolved over time.

The dataset has been widely used in political science research to study bargaining dynamics, the influence of institutional rules on policy outcomes, and the effects of treaty changes on legislative efficiency in the EU.
