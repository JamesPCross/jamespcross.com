[ParliView](https://parliview.org) is an AI-driven parliamentary transparency tool developed with funding from a Google.org Impact Challenge grant (EUR 1.5m). The project aims to make parliamentary debates more accessible to citizens, journalists, and researchers by providing automated transcription, translation, and analysis of parliamentary proceedings.

The tool processes thousands of hours of parliamentary debate footage, using speech recognition and natural language processing to create searchable, structured records of what elected representatives say and how they vote. ParliView enables cross-party and cross-country comparisons, helping users understand patterns in political discourse and legislative behaviour.

The project is a collaboration between the Connected_Politics Lab at UCD and partners across Europe, reflecting a commitment to using AI and computational methods to strengthen democratic accountability and transparency.
