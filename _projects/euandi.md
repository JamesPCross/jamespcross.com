The [EUandI](https://euandi.eu/) (EU and I) Voter Advice Application is a tool that helps citizens across Europe discover which political parties best match their policy preferences ahead of European Parliament elections. The application presents users with a series of policy statements and compares their responses with the positions of parties running in their country.

I have led the Irish contribution to the EUandI project across three European Parliament election cycles (2014, 2019, and 2024). In the 2024 European Parliament elections, the application attracted 3.5 million views, demonstrating its significant reach and impact on voter engagement across Europe.

The project is a collaborative effort involving researchers from multiple European universities and is designed to promote informed democratic participation by making complex policy positions accessible and comparable.
